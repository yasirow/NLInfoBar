## 1. Goals and priorities

Windows 11 no longer supports taskbar toolbars (deskbands), so NetLimiter's own InfoBar cannot be shown there.
NLInfoBar is a separate, small window that sits on the taskbar and shows the same two numbers.

When requirements conflict, the higher one wins:

1. **Lightweight.** No runtime dependency other than NetLimiter and the .NET Framework that ships with Windows.
2. **Never disturb full-screen games or applications.**
3. **Follow the taskbar** on any screen edge.
4. **Never trigger anti-cheat systems.**
5. **Never touch other programs** — their files, folders, registry keys, processes or windows. NLInfoBar only reads
   data from NetLimiter.
6. **Show two values:** upload (red ⬆) and download (green ⬇).
7. **Security first.**

## 2. Architecture

One process, one executable, C# on .NET Framework 4.8 with WinForms, x64.

| Component | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Entry point | `Program.cs` | Single-instance mutex, error handling, starts the API loader and the bar |
| API loader | `Api/NlApiLoader.cs`, `Api/Authenticode.cs` | Finds the installed NetLimiter, verifies and loads its API assemblies |
| Session | `Api/NlSession.cs` | The **only** code that uses NetLimiter types: connect, read the zone rate |
| Monitor | `Api/NlMonitor.cs` | Background thread: connects, reads once per second, reconnects, publishes readings |
| Bar | `BarForm.cs`, `BarLayout.cs`, `LayeredWindow.cs` | The window, its drawing and its placement |
| Taskbar | `Taskbar.cs` | Read-only taskbar and notification-area geometry |
| Settings, log | `Settings.cs`, `Log.cs`, `AppPaths.cs` | `settings.json`, the rotating log, where files may be written |
| Win32 | `NativeMethods.cs` | Every native call, see the allow-list in [§7](#7-security-model) |

Threads: the UI thread (window, shell notifications) and one monitor thread (NetLimiter). WCF callbacks from the
NetLimiter client only set a flag; they never touch the UI.

**Why .NET Framework 4.8:** the official NetLimiter API targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and uses WCF
(`System.ServiceModel`), which .NET 5+ does not provide. .NET Framework 4.8 is part of Windows 10 and 11, so
nothing extra has to be installed.

**Why x64:** `NetLimiter.dll` and `NLInterop.dll` are built for AMD64 only. On ARM64 Windows, an x64 process runs
under emulation and can load them; an AnyCPU process would start as ARM64 and fail.

## 3. NetLimiter API

### 3.1 Where it comes from

At run time the API is loaded **read-only from the installed NetLimiter**, so it always matches the running
service. No NetLimiter file is ever copied into this repository, the build output or a release package.

- **Install folder:** the `InstallLocation` of NetLimiter's uninstall entry under
  `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall` (both registry views; read only), or the default
  `%ProgramFiles%\Locktime Software\NetLimiter`.
- **Allow-list:** `AppDomain.AssemblyResolve` loads only these names from that folder, with `Assembly.LoadFile` so
  that every dependency passes through the same check:

  | Assembly | Expected signer (O=) | Why it is loaded |
  |---|---|---|
  | `NetLimiter` | Locktime Software s.r.o. | The API |
  | `NLInterop`, `CoreLibNet` | Locktime Software s.r.o. | Dependencies of `NetLimiter.dll` |
  | `VirusTotalNet` | Locktime Software s.r.o. | Referenced by `CoreLibNet` types; loaded but **never called** |
  | `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions`, `System.Memory`, `System.Buffers`, `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe` | Microsoft Corporation | Dependencies of `NetLimiter.dll` |

  Any other name is refused and logged; the bar then shows `API?`.
- **Signature check:** before loading, `WinVerifyTrust` verifies the file's embedded Authenticode signature and its
  chain to a trusted root, **without network access** (`WTD_REVOKE_NONE`, `WTD_CACHE_ONLY_URL_RETRIEVAL`). The
  signer certificate's organization must match the table. Certificate thumbprints are not pinned, because
  certificates are renewed.
- **Location check:** if an allow-listed assembly is ever loaded by anything other than this loader (for example a
  `NetLimiter.dll` dropped next to the executable), the app logs it and exits. Microsoft assemblies loaded from the
  Global Assembly Cache are accepted.
- **Type isolation:** only `NlSession` references NetLimiter types, and it is first used inside a `try` block after
  the loader is installed. A missing, refused or incompatible API becomes a status in the bar, never a crash.

### 3.2 Connection

- `new NLClient().Connect()` with no arguments connects to the **local** service over its named pipe. The host,
  port and credential parameters are never used; remote connections and the TCP binding are never enabled.
- Only NetLimiter's **Monitor** right is needed, which a standard user normally has. NLInfoBar never calls
  NetLimiter's elevation functions and never changes NetLimiter's settings or access table.
- The connection state comes from the `StateChanged` event. A lost connection is retried with an exponential
  back-off of 2, 4, 8, 16 and then every 30 seconds.

### 3.3 Reading the speed

```csharp
NodeLoader loader = client.CreateNodeLoader();
loader.Filters.SelectAll();      // filter nodes only; applications and connections are never requested
loader.Load();
foreach (FilterNode node in loader.Filters.Nodes)
    if (node.FilterId == zone.InternalId) { down = node.TransferRate.In; up = node.TransferRate.Out; }
```

- The zone is NetLimiter's Internet zone unless `zoneFilterId` is set.
- The API has no rate event, so the rate is read once per second on the monitor thread. A read that takes longer
  than 2 seconds counts as a lost connection. Typical cost: connecting ~0.3 s, each read 1–10 ms.
- Reading stops completely while the bar is hidden for a full-screen application and while the session is locked.
- The bar is redrawn only when the displayed text changes.

### 3.4 States

| Bar shows | Meaning |
|---|---|
| speeds, coloured arrows | Connected |
| `…` | Connecting |
| `—` | NetLimiter service not reachable (retrying) |
| `denied` / `izin yok` | NetLimiter refused the Monitor right |
| `API?` | API assembly refused (signature) or incompatible NetLimiter version |
| `NL?` | NetLimiter is not installed |

The tooltip shows the full description and the exception type behind a failure — never an exception message,
because messages can contain paths.

## 4. Window and rendering

- A WinForms form created as a **popup** (`WS_POPUP`) tool window: `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` (not in Alt+Tab or on the
  taskbar), `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` and `WM_MOUSEACTIVATE` → `MA_NOACTIVATE` (**never takes focus**), `WS_EX_TOPMOST`,
  `WS_EX_LAYERED`. WinForms' default overlapped style would make Windows enforce a minimum window height that does
  not fit a thin taskbar.
- **Transparent background:** the content is drawn with GDI+ into a 32-bit ARGB bitmap and pushed with
  `UpdateLayeredWindow` (per-pixel alpha), only when it changes. The background alpha is 1/255: invisible, but every
  pixel stays clickable. Text uses grayscale anti-aliasing, because ClearType fringes on a transparent background.
- **Layout:** two lines; upload with a red up arrow on top, download with a green down arrow below; text
  left-aligned after the arrow. Arrows are drawn shapes (triangle head and stem), not font glyphs. Segoe UI 9 pt,
  scaled for DPI and reduced (down to 7 pt) when two lines do not fit the taskbar.
- **Fixed width:** the text column is measured from the widest possible value, so the bar never resizes.
- **Units:** B/s → KB/s → MB/s → GB/s, base 1024 (or 1000), one decimal by default. Values are truncated, never
  rounded up. The decimal separator follows the Windows region settings.
- **Menu:** a native Win32 menu (`TrackPopupMenuEx` via WinForms `ContextMenu`). The bar calls
  `SetForegroundWindow` only when the user right-clicks it, so the menu can close when the user clicks elsewhere.
- **UI language:** Turkish when the Windows display language is Turkish, English otherwise.

## 5. Taskbar tracking

- **Geometry:** `SHAppBarMessage(ABM_GETTASKBARPOS)` gives the edge and rectangle; if it fails, the rectangle of the
  `Shell_TrayWnd` window and its monitor are used. Both are read-only.
- **Default position:** just before the notification area — `FindWindowEx(Shell_TrayWnd, "TrayNotifyWnd")` — on
  the taskbar surface, like the original InfoBar. If the notification area cannot be found, 220 DIP from the end of
  the taskbar.
- **AppBar registration:** the bar registers with `ABM_NEW` **without** `ABM_SETPOS`: no screen space is reserved
  and the taskbar is not changed. This only subscribes the bar to shell notifications:
  `ABN_POSCHANGED`, `ABN_STATECHANGE`, `ABN_FULLSCREENAPP`. It unregisters with `ABM_REMOVE`.
- **Other triggers:** `WM_DISPLAYCHANGE`, `WM_DPICHANGED`, `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` (`SPI_SETWORKAREA`) and the
  `TaskbarCreated` message (Explorer restarted: register again). Bursts are coalesced into one reposition after
  100 ms. There is no polling timer.
- **Growing notification area:** the shell sends no notification when the notification area grows (a new tray
  icon, a wider clock). In the default position the notification area's rectangle is compared on each once-per-second
  reading the bar already receives — one `GetWindowRect`, no extra timer.
- **Vertical taskbars:** the same two-line layout, centred on the taskbar.

## 6. Full screen and z-order

### 6.1 Full screen

- **Signal:** `ABN_FULLSCREENAPP` from the shell — the same signal the taskbar uses to hide itself. It covers
  borderless windowed games. No hook, no polling.
- **Hiding means hiding:** `SWP_HIDEWINDOW` and leaving the topmost band (`HWND_NOTOPMOST`), and the monitor stops
  reading. Making the bar transparent would not be enough: Windows' compositor still counts an overlapping window,
  which can disable full-screen optimisations.
- **Coming back:** shown again with `SWP_SHOWWINDOW | SWP_NOACTIVATE`, back in the topmost band, one reading
  immediately.

### 6.2 Staying above the taskbar

The taskbar is an always-on-top window as well. When it is clicked, when Start or a jump list opens, or when it
shows itself again after a full-screen application, it raises itself above other always-on-top windows. Windows
offers no "the taskbar moved above you" notification.

- The bar listens to one range of WinEvents **out of context** (`WINEVENT_OUTOFCONTEXT | WINEVENT_SKIPOWNPROCESS`):
  `EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND` through `EVENT_SYSTEM_CAPTUREEND` — foreground changes, menu start/end and mouse capture
  start/end. Out of context means Windows posts the events to the bar's own message loop; nothing is loaded into
  any other process.
- On each event, and then every 50 ms for about 600 ms, the bar checks whether the taskbar is above it by reading
  the window order (`GetWindow(GW_HWNDPREV)`). Only if it is covered does it move itself directly above the taskbar
  (not to the very top), so Start, jump lists and tooltips stay above the bar. With no events, nothing runs.
- If the new foreground window covers its monitor, the bar does not come forward; the full-screen notification
  hides it instead.
- A few milliseconds of overlap can remain. Avoiding even that would require becoming part of the taskbar, which
  rule 5 forbids. Making the taskbar the bar's owner window is also rejected: Explorer restarts would destroy the bar.

## 7. Security model

### 7.1 Never

- `SetWindowsHookEx` of any kind (including low-level keyboard and mouse hooks), in-context WinEvent hooks, DLL
  injection, `SetParent` into the taskbar, making the taskbar the bar's owner, or any interaction with another
  process' memory or windows beyond reading positions.
- Process memory access, overlays, DirectX/OpenGL/Vulkan layers, drivers.
- Requesting administrator rights or elevating (`asInvoker` manifest; NetLimiter's elevation calls are never used).
- Any network connection or listening port. The API's internet features (VirusTotal, DNS, HTTP) are never called.
- NetLimiter's remote connection, its TCP binding, or changes to its settings, rules or access table.
- Writing to another program's files, folders or registry keys.
- Telemetry, automatic updates, crash reporting, or downloading anything.
- Storing credentials (the named pipe uses the Windows identity).

### 7.2 Allowed Win32 calls

| Purpose | Calls |
|---|---|
| Taskbar geometry and notifications | `SHAppBarMessage`, `FindWindow`, `FindWindowEx`, `GetWindowRect`, `RegisterWindowMessage("TaskbarCreated")` |
| Monitors and DPI | `MonitorFromRect`, `MonitorFromWindow`, `GetMonitorInfo`, `GetDpiForMonitor` |
| Our own window | `SetWindowPos`, `UpdateLayeredWindow`, `GetDC`, `ReleaseDC`, `CreateCompatibleDC`, `DeleteDC`, `SelectObject`, `DeleteObject`, `SetForegroundWindow` (only on right-click) |
| Window order | `SetWinEventHook` (out of context only), `UnhookWinEvent`, `GetWindow(GW_HWNDPREV)` |
| Our own process | `SetErrorMode` (no error dialogs), `WinVerifyTrust` (API signature, no network) |

Planned for later milestones and subject to the same rules: `GetForegroundWindow`, `SHQueryUserNotificationState`,
`RegisterHotKey` (never a keyboard hook), and `OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION)` only if the optional
game list is enabled.

### 7.3 Failure behaviour

- Every thread boundary catches and logs exceptions and turns them into a status.
- An unhandled exception is logged and ends only this process (`Environment.Exit`). Windows error dialogs are
  suppressed (`SetErrorMode`), so nothing can pop up over a game.

## 8. Files and settings

NLInfoBar writes only next to its executable when that folder is writable (the installer's default), otherwise to
`%LocalAppData%\NLInfoBar`. It never writes the registry and never registers itself to start with Windows; only the
installer's optional, unchecked "start with Windows" task creates a shortcut in the user's Startup folder.

### 8.1 `settings.json`

Optional. Read at start-up; ignored (with a log entry) if it is invalid or larger than 64 KB. The app does not write
it yet.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `zoneFilterId` | `null` | NetLimiter filter ID of the zone to show; `null` = Internet zone |
| `unitBase` | `1024` | `1024` or `1000` |
| `decimals` | `1` | 0–3 |
| `theme` | `"dark"` | `"dark"` or `"light"` (text colour) |
| `colors.upload` / `colors.download` | `"#E74C3C"` / `"#2ECC71"` | Arrow colours |
| `colors.text` | `null` | `null` = from theme (`#FFFFFF` dark, `#1A1A1A` light) |
| `colors.background` | `null` | `null` = transparent; a colour is drawn with `opacity` |
| `opacity` | `0.85` | Background opacity when a background colour is set |
| `anchorOffsetDip` | `null` | `null` = before the notification area; otherwise DIP from the taskbar's end |
| `hideOnFullscreen` | `true` | Hide while a full-screen application is in front |
| `logLevel` | `"info"` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

Example:

```json
{ "decimals": 2, "unitBase": 1000, "colors": { "download": "#00C853" } }
```

### 8.2 `nlinfobar.log`

At most 256 KB plus one backup (`nlinfobar.log.1`). Before a line is written, the user profile, AppData and temp
paths, the user name (as a path segment) and the computer name are replaced with placeholders, so a log can be
attached to a public issue.

## 9. Build and supply chain

- **SDK:** .NET SDK 10 (pinned by `global.json`, feature roll-forward). `build.ps1` keeps all SDK and NuGet state
  inside the repository: it points `USERPROFILE`, `APPDATA`, `LOCALAPPDATA`, `DOTNET_CLI_HOME` and the NuGet cache
  variables at `.dotnet-home`, `.packages` and `.nuget` for the build processes, disables telemetry, first-run
  side effects and background update checks, and leaves no MSBuild or compiler server running.
- **NetLimiter API at compile time:** the official `NetLimiter` package from nuget.org (owner LocktimeSoftware) is
  fetched with `PackageDownload`, so none of its dependencies are downloaded. The compiler references
  `runtimes/win-x64/lib/net462/NetLimiter.dll` with `Private=false`, and the build fails unless the file's SHA-256
  matches the value pinned in the project (pinned after verifying the package's author and repository signatures
  with `dotnet nuget verify`).
- **Other packages:** only Microsoft's .NET Framework reference assemblies (build-time only). They are referenced
  explicitly, so a clean PC and a CI runner with the targeting pack installed compile against the same files; they
  are locked by `packages.lock.json` and restored in locked mode.
- **Output check:** the build fails if its output contains anything other than `NLInfoBar.exe` and
  `NLInfoBar.exe.config`.
- **Reproducibility and privacy:** `Deterministic`, `PathMap` and no PDB in Release, so no build-machine path or user
  name is embedded in the executable. Warnings are errors.
- **CI:** GitHub-hosted `windows-2025` runners, actions pinned by commit SHA, read-only token except for the
  release job.

## 10. Packaging

Each release has three files, built by the release workflow from the tagged commit:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `NLInfoBar-Setup-x.y.z.exe` | Per-user Inno Setup installer |
| `NLInfoBar-x.y.z-portable.zip` | The executable and its notices, to run from any folder |
| `SHA256SUMS.txt` | SHA-256 of both files |

**Installer:** installs to `%LocalAppData%\Programs\NLInfoBar` without administrator rights
(`PrivilegesRequired=lowest`), adds a Start menu shortcut and, only if the user ticks it, a Startup shortcut. It
closes a running NLInfoBar first. Installing a newer version over an older one upgrades in place and keeps
`settings.json`. It never touches `HKLM`, `Program Files`, NetLimiter, or any other program.

**Uninstall** (Windows Settings → Apps) removes exactly: the installed files, the shortcuts it created, its own
uninstall entry under `HKCU`, and — by name — `settings.json`, `nlinfobar.log` and `nlinfobar.log.1` in the install
folder and in `%LocalAppData%\NLInfoBar`, then those folders if they are empty. Nothing else.

**Portable:** unzip anywhere and run; remove by deleting the folder.

**Signing:** releases are not code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen may warn on first run. Each release publishes
SHA-256 checksums.

## 11. Known limitations

- The bar cannot be dragged and its position is not saved yet.
- An auto-hiding taskbar is not supported yet.
- Started while a full-screen game is already in front, the bar does not hide until that game closes.
- Only the primary taskbar is used.
- The bar cannot reserve space on the taskbar; with many taskbar buttons it can overlap them.
